## Ray Tracing in One Weekend
Learning to implement a ray tracer by following along with
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

I won't be doing this in one weekend but over a couple of weeks/months when I get time.


# Examples
I started taking screen shot examples as I went once I got about half way through.

### 1. Creating a metallic material

### 2. Creating a dielectric material - eg: a glass ball
